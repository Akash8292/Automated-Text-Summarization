## About

# Abstract
This project is a Automated text summarization system that employs extractive and abstractive techniques. It processes a PDF document, tokenizes the text, removes stopwords, and lemmatizes the remaining words using NLTK. Sentences are ranked based on their importance, calculated using TF-IDF scores, sentence position, and cosine similarity. The top-ranked sentences form an extractive summary.

The system then uses the pre-trained `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model from Hugging Face's transformers library to generate an abstractive summary. This summary is further refined to create a final summary.

The quality of the generated summary is evaluated using BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR scores. The system outputs the original text, the extractive and abstractive summaries, the final summary, and the evaluation scores. The end result is a concise, high-quality summary of the original text, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining different summarization techniques and evaluation metrics.

# Details
The TfidfVectorizer in the code is used for converting a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features. It works by tokenizing the text, counting the occurrences of tokens, and then normalizing the counts based on the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) principle.The TF-IDF value of a term in a document is the product of its term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF). The TF-IDF value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. This helps in emphasizing words that are more specific to a particular document while discounting common words that occur in many documents.

The TfidfVectorizer in the code leverages this functionality to transform the filtered sentences into a TF-IDF matrix, where each row represents a sentence, and each column represents a unique word in the corpus. This matrix is then used to calculate the importance of sentences based on their TF-IDF scores and to perform tasks such as extractive summarization.

In summary, the TfidfVectorizer is a crucial component for text processing and feature extraction, providing a numerical representation of text data that can be utilized for various natural language processing tasks, including document summarization, classification, and clustering.

### Cosine Similarity
Cosine similarity is a measure used to determine how similar two vectors are in a multi-dimensional space. In the context of natural language processing, it is often used to assess the similarity between two documents represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space, such as the TF-IDF vector space.

### BLEU Score (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score)
The BLEU score is a metric used to evaluate the quality of machine-translated text by comparing it to one or more reference translations. It measures the similarity between the candidate translation and the reference translations based on n-gram precision, where n represents the length of the n-grams (typically 1 to 4). The BLEU score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect match between the candidate and reference translations. It is widely used in machine translation and natural language processing to assess the accuracy of generated text.

### ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)
ROUGE is a set of metrics designed to evaluate the quality of summaries generated by automatic summarization systems. It measures the overlap between the generated summary and the reference summaries in terms of n-gram overlap, word overlap, and recall. ROUGE scores include ROUGE-N (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, etc.), ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence), and ROUGE-W (weighted longest common subsequence). These scores provide a comprehensive evaluation of the informativeness and fluency of the generated summary compared to the reference summaries.

### METEOR Score (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering)
The METEOR score is an evaluation metric for machine translation and text generation, focusing on the alignment and matching of words and phrases between the generated output and the reference text. It incorporates various linguistic features such as stemming, synonyms, and paraphrases to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the similarity between the generated text and the reference text. The METEOR score is designed to address some limitations of other metrics like BLEU by considering a wider range of linguistic variations and providing a more nuanced evaluation of the generated output.
These evaluation metrics are essential for assessing the quality and accuracy of machine-generated text across different natural language processing tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and language generation.
